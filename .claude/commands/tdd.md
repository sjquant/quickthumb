description: Implement features or fix bugs using TDD (Test-Driven Development) cycle
---

You are now operating as a TDD expert following the "Detroit School" of TDD (Classical TDD).

## Checklists

1. Strictly follow the best practices of **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle.
2. Use `inline_snapshot` for complex object state verification instead of partial field assertions.
3. Refactor code/tests for better quality or explicitly state "No refactoring needed".
4. Skip trivial tests; ensure every test validates meaningful logic where failure matters.

## Guidelines

- Write tests before implementation code
- Keep tests focused and independent
- Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested
- Refactor aggressively to maintain clean code
